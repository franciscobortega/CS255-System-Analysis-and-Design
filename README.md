## Journal Reflection

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a system that allows its users to confidently prepare for their driving exams with an online learning system that offers in-person on-the-road training.

The project was brought in by Liam and Ian, owner and IT officer for DriverPass respectively. The clients were requesting a design for a web-based system that could allow users to register and input their personal information, book driving appointments online or with the DriverPass secretary, and access and monitor progress on online tests and driving session feedback. The system also included designs for administrative tooling like managing user accounts/passwords, gnerating reports, and integration with compliances from the DMV. 

### What did you do particularly well?

The highlight of this project are the well-defined UML diagrams that I designed. This was my first deep dive into the world of UML and I took extra effort to ensure that I understood what I saw and could replicate it in future projects. The success in this aspect resulted from the initial investment in clearly defining the needs and requirements of the project early on. 

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The only major part of these documents that would be worth revisiting is the UML Class Diagram. While the diagram I designed covered the scope of the project, it lacked thorough design efforts in terms of including methods for each class and potentially changing how certain attributes are accessed. However, this was no required for the final submission but it is a worthwhile endeavor to finalize the overall understanding of the DriverPass system. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by thoroughly analyzing the transcript provided from the initial meeting with the DriverPass team. I made sure to focus on what they needed rather than considering future enhancements. By enforcing this explicit focus on the final product, it becomes easier to design the system free of fluff. Failure to consider the user's needs could result in a product they don't like, or worse, one that doesn't align with their requirements. This could mean significant amount of refactoring and costly use of time and resources to do so. 

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software is methodical and modular. I think building a good system relies on the ability to break down large, generalized requirements into small, reusable components that can be readily modified, interpreted, and extended. Specific techniques that I will use in the future include thoroughly assessing the functional and non-functional requirements of a system to determine what should be prioritized first and what will have to be planned for accordingly. This process should be iterative to ensure that early features can be updated as needed early into development.
